# MIPS_processor
This Verilog code implements a simple 32-bit MIPS processor. It consists of multiple interconnected modules that simulate the behavior of a typical MIPS pipeline. The modules define the key components required for executing MIPS instructions, including the program counter (PC), ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), register file
